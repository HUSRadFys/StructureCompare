# StructureCompare
Code to compare differently drawn / generated RT Structure sets. The output are images containing visual comparisons together with spreadsheets containing HD95 and DICE statistics.

Put the files in the following order:
- Structure Class
-  -> Images (DICOM CT)
-  -> Structures
-      -> Vendors (single RT Struct file per vendor)
-      -> GroundTruth (single RT Struct file with target comparison)
-  -> Output (This is where the results will be stored)
